# Arduino-NB-IoT-Shield

This is the repository of sixfab arduino nb-iot shield.

# Product Description
This is a Narrow-Band IoT(LTE CAT-NB1) shield for Arduino, based on Quectelâ€™s BC95 module. NB-IoT is a Low Power Wide Area(LPWA) technology that is the latest cellular network option for low power connected projects.

The design has built-in temperature, humidity, light sensors, 3-axis accelerometer, relay and a chip antenna. If there is a need for long-range, better signal quality, a U.FL antenna receptacle is placed, can be selected over RF Switch by the short-headers easily.
